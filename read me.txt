Capital One Interview: Coding Exercise

Objective/Operations:
1. Loads a user's transactions from the GetAllTransactions endpoint.
2. Determines how much money the user spends and makes in each of the months for which we have data, and in the "average" month. What "average" means is up to you.
3. Output these numbers in the following format (and optionally in a more pretty format, if you see fit)
4. --ignore-donuts: The user is so enthusiastic about donuts that they don't want donut spending to come out of their budget. Disregard all donut-related transactions from the spending. You can just use the merchant field to determine what's a donut - donut transactions will be named “Krispy Kreme Donuts” or “DUNKIN #336784”.
5. --crystal-ball: We expose a GetProjectedTransactionsForMonth endpoint, which returns all the transactions that have happened or are expected to happen for a given month. It looks like right now it only works for this month, but that's OK. Merge the results of this API call with the full list from GetAllTransactions and use it to generate predicted spending and income numbers for the rest of this month, in addition to previous months.
6. --ignore-cc-payments: Paying off a credit card shows up as a credit transaction and a debit transaction, but it's not really "spending" or "income". Make your aggregate numbers disregard credit card payments. For the users we give you, credit card payments will consist of two transactions with opposite amounts (e.g. 5000000 centocents and -5000000 centocents) within 24 hours of each other. For verification, you should also output a list of the credit card payments you detected - this can be in whatever format you like.

Requirements:
- Windows or Linux machine
- XAMPP & LAMP Server (PHP 5.5 or later)
- Chrome or Firefox browser

How to execute:
- Extract all the cap_one folder and copy it under the "www" directory of the localhost server.
- If the localhost service is installed then use "localhost" in place for the <url> otherwise use the ip address of the server where the code is extracted.
- To run the operation 1-3, enter the following link in the browser: <url>/cap_one/index.php
- To run the operation 4, enter the following link in the browser: <url>/cap_one/ignore-donuts.php
- To run the operation 5, enter the following link in the browser: <url>/cap_one/crystal-ball.php
- To run the operation 6, enter the following link in the browser: <url>/cap_one/ignore-cc-payments.php
